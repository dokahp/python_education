<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Description</strong></h2>

<p>You're working on a college newspaper called HyperNews. You are comfortable in the digital world, so you came up with the idea of publishing the news online and decided to create a website for this.</p>

<p><br>
Creating the HyperNews website will take some time, so for now you’ll create a “Coming soon” page.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Objectives</strong></h2>

<p>Create the first handler for your server.</p>

<p>If you start the project on your computer with the <code class="java">python manage.py runserver</code> command, your server should respond with the text "Coming soon" at the <em>localhost:8000</em>. address.</p>
